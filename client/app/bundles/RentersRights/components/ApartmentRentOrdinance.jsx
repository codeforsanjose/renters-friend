                              <p>On April 24, 2018, the City Council approved an amendment to the ARO providing clarification that Ratio Utility Billing System (RUBS) is not allowed and additionally establishing a petition process to be described in the Regulations for landlords with existing RUBS contracts. The City Council requested staff to work with the Attorney’s Office to prepare a further amendment to the ARO clarifying that RUBS agreements will be allowed until October 31, 2018 or until the decision on a landlord’s petition for a one-time rent increase, whichever is sooner. This second amendment was adopted by the City Council on June 5, 2018, at which time the City Council directed staff to take an amendment to the Regulations establishing the petition process to the City Manager for approval.</p>
                              <p>Additionally, since the ARO and Regulations changed most of the longstanding petition procedures, questions about the new procedures have arisen and staff and the hearing officers have identified opportunities for improvement to customer service and processes related to implementation of the petition process by the Regulations. Staff also received feedback from a range of stakeholders while developing the amendments to the Regulations.</p>
                              <p>The amendments to the <a href='http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/73546' target='_blank'>ARO Regulations</a> include:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><strong>Clarification of Timelines in the Petition Process:</strong> Through the Regulations, amendments were made to number of days a tenant or landlord may respond to a submitted petition. For example, for Incomplete Petitions in Section 5.03.1.b, the petitioner now has 30 days instead of 10 days to complete the petition or otherwise be considered withdrawn. For a response to a submitted petition, the responding party (tenant or landlord) will now have 14 days instead of 30 days from the mailing of the notice that a complete petition was received. This change was a recommended change from stakeholders including the Hearing Officers, landlords, and tenants who provided feedback that 30 days was too long of a timeframe to respond to a petition.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clarifications to the Hearing Process under Chapter 6 and 7:</strong> Under these chapters, clarifications were made to the following: 1) the notice and timing of a hearing (7.11.1); 2) what Administration Decision should include (6.03); 3) the open session requirement for voluntary mediation hearings (7.04.1 and 7.04.4); 4) when a claim for violating a Voluntary Agreement may be filed (7.04.6); 5) the timeframe for Mediator/Hearing Officer’s decisions following an unresolved mediation hearing (7.04.7); 6) the three types of Ch. 7 hearings (7.05-7.05.3); and 7) what statutes constitute Housing Code Violations (7.09).   </li>
                                <li><strong>City Will Hold the Official Hearing Record:</strong>Under Section 5.06, the City will be responsible for retaining the official Hearing records after the proceedings under any Chapter in the Regulations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Addition of Chapter 13:</strong> On the May 22, 2018 City Council meeting, staff was directed to submit to the City Manager for approval a proposed amendment adding Chapter 13 to the ARO Regulations, which describes the offset petition process. The recommended changes will further amend the ARO so that utility pass through agreements executed with existing tenants before January 1, 2018 are not expressly void until the landlord’s offset petition is decided. The period for filing petitions will be from July 5, 2018 to October 31, 2018. Landlords who can demonstrate a standing business process of requiring pass throughs for all tenants since June 2017 may also participate in the offset petition process for those agreements executed between January 1, 2018 and May 1, 2018.</li>

                            <p> ARO allows tenants to request an administrative hearing for a service reduction claim. </p>
                            <p> The tenant has the burden of proof to their claim by submitting evidence such as maintenance record requests, photographs, and/or testimony.</p>
                            <p>If the claim is proven, the Hearing Officer will determine the percentage that the usability of the rental unit was reduced and the duration of the reduction.</p>
                            If the rent increase is unreasonable, the Hearing Officer may reduce a rent increase, order a credit against the paid and/or permanent or temporary reduction in future rent.</p>
