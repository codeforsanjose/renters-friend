                          <p>On Tuesday, April 24, 2018, the City Council took action to amend the Ellis Act Ordinance, Tenant Protection Ordinance (TPO), and Apartment Rent Ordinance (ARO). Over the past several months, City of San Jose has worked with community and stakeholders to develop recommendations for these challenging issues. The following list the results from the City Council meeting regarding the Tenant Protection Ordinance:</p>

                            <li>Include "criminal activity" as a separate just cause basis for eviction when a tenant is "held to answer" for a serious or violent felony committed during tenancy and within a 1,000 ft. of the premises;</li>
                            <li>Include an "opportunity to cure" that would require that landlords to provide tenant households a written notice to remove the tenant who was held to answer from the apartment or from the lease agreement;</li>
                            <li>Return with a proposed ordinance after analysis to require landlords to post in the common areas a notice stating that it is illegal for a landlord to disclose immigration status of a tenant;</li>  <li>Return with proposed ordinance after analysis to require landlords to allow a right to repossession of the unit where an acquittal or dismissal of the tenant's felony charges;</li>
                            <li>Return with proposed ordinance after analysis to allow victims of domestic violence who have been residing in a unit with the leaseholder who is the alleged abuser a mechanism to take over the lease; and</li>
                            <li>Return with proposed ordinance after analysis to extend TPO to duplexes requiring a just cause for termination of tenancy.</li>
                          </ul>

                          </ul>
                          <br/><br/>
